<h1>People (generated from YAML)</h1>

<ul>
{% for person in site.data.members %}
  <li><a href="{{ person.full_name | datapage_url: 'people' }}">{{person.full_name}}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<h1>Pets (generated from JSON)</h1>

<ul>
{% for pet in site.data.pets %}
    <li><a href="{{ pet.pet_name | datapage_url: 'pets' }}">{{pet.pet_name}}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<h1>Filter Examples (generated from book in YAML)</h1>

<h2>Approach 1: Filter Links, Generate all pages</h2>

<p>In the page <a href="books.html">books</a>, the books are organized in two lists: books I have read and those I have not.  However a page is still generated for each book. <b>This is not a filter on the pages being generated: it is only a filter on the links being generated.</b></p>

<h2>Approach 2: <tt>filter</tt> keyword</h2>

<p>If the yaml matter has a boolean field (for instance: <tt>filter</tt> or, more evocatively, <tt>publish</tt>), I can specify it in <tt>_config</tt> to select what pages have to be generated.</p>
